            <div>
               <h4>Where were they taken?</h5>
              <p><p>Those arrested in Cleveland are usually taken to <a href="http://www.city.cleveland.oh.us/CityofCleveland/Home/Government/CityAgencies/PublicSafety/Corrections/Cleveland_City_Jail">Cleveland City Jail</a> located in the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/uxca79TWK1n">Justice Center at 1300 Ontario Street</a>. For the RNC, Cleveland has contracted with Cuyahoga County (also located within the Justice Center), Geauga County, and Summit County jails to house additional arrestees. There is also the possibility that arrestees will be held at various Cleveland Division of Police District stations, the Oriana House, or the House of Corrections (the “Workhouse”).</p>

               <h4>How do I locate them?</h4>
              <p><p>All currently available information about arrestees can be obtained by calling our jail support hotline at (216) 5050-NLG (654).</p>

<p>Keep in mind that in the event of mass arrests, arrestees will likely be sitting in police vans, busses, etc for several hours and will not be immediately transported to the jail for processing and phone calls. Check in with our jail support hotline and stay by your phone in case they call you.</p>

               <h4>When will they be released?</h5>
              <p><p>Generally, arrestees must be processed within 48 hours or within a “reasonable amount of time” of their arrest. Cleveland Municipal Court has cleared their dockets and extended their hours from 8:30am-4:30pm to 5:00am to 1:00am in order to speed up the processing of RNC arrestees. However, processing time still depends on how quickly the police and prosecutors complete the arrestees’ charging paperwork.</p>

               <h4>What if I'm not a citizen and/or undocumented?</h5>
              <p><p>It is <strong>extremely important</strong> that you do not answer any questions about your immigration status, enter into a plea agreement, or sign <strong>anything</strong> without speaking to an experienced immigration attorney first! A conviction for a “crime involving moral turpitude” can land a non-citizen in removal proceedings, or jeopardize their chances of receiving a green card or of obtaining citizenship. If you’re on a student visa, a violation of your university’s code of conduct that leads to your explusion will also result in the revocation of your student visa.</p>

               <h4>Can I go back out to protest? </h5>
              <p><p>Sort of. A judge can’t prevent you from exercising your constitutional rights; however, you are required to comply with the terms of your bond which may include a stay away order from certain people or property. Also, while an additional arrest technically won’t influence your original charges, your bail may be set higher or with more strigent conditions for subsequent arrests.</p>

      <li>You are a witness to a felony.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Loudly &amp; clearly ask, “<em>Am I legally required to identify myself?</em>”</li>
  <li>If the answer is yes, <strong>only</strong> then are you obligated provide:
    <ul>
      <li>Your legal name, date of birth, and address</li>
      <li>If you refuse to identify yourself in those situations, you can be arrested.</li>

              <p><ul>
  <li>Stay calm and ask “<em>Am I being detained?</em>”
    <ul>
      <li>If the answer is no, ask “<em>Am I free to leave?</em>”
        <ul>
          <li>If the answer is no, you are being detained.</li>

      </li>
      <li>If the answer is yes, you must stay but are <strong>not</strong> obligated to answer <strong>any</strong> questions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Loudly &amp; clearly state, “<em>I am going to remain silent</em>” and then remain completely silent - even if officers continue to speak to you.
    <ul>
      <li>If you begin to speak for <strong>any</strong> reason, you must verbally reinvoke your right to remain silent.</li>

               <h4>Am I allowed to record law enforcement?</h5>
              <p><ul>
  <li>It is <strong>legal</strong> to record law enforcement performing their official duties in public in all fifty states.
    <ul>
      <li>However, you may not obstruct or interfere with the performance of their duties or ignore orders to disperse.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Absent a valid search warrant, you are <strong>not</strong> required to hand over your camera or to show officers your footage. You are also never obligated to answer questions about what or why you’re recording.</li>
  <li><strong>Never</strong> document anything that could <strong>even remotely</strong> be construed by a prosecutor, jury, or the public as resisting arrest or assault on an officer.</li>
  <li>If you have footage of police brutality, the safest thing to do with such footage is to make the victim and their attorney (if any) aware of it.</li>
  <li>Immediately uploading footage to the Internet can have <strong>unintended negative repercussions</strong>, such as being used as evidence <strong>against</strong> the victim of police brutality.</li>

Under the City’s new <a href="http://www.acluohio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CDP-RevisedDispersalOrder-2015_0827.pdf">mass arrest dispersal order</a>, officers must warn demonstrators three times and identify exit routes prior to engaging in a mass arrest of demonstrators.
