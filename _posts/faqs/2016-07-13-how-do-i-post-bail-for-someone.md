title: How do I post bail for someone?
---
To obtain a [Cleveland Municipal Court bond](http://www.city.cleveland.oh.us/CityofCleveland/Home/Government/CityAgencies/PublicSafety/Corrections/Bonds) directly, visit the [2nd floor of the Justice Center at 1200 Ontario Street](https://goo.gl/maps/9cPspHcHCY82) [phone: (216) 664-4790]. Bonds can be posted 24 hours a day with cash or a credit card (Visa, Mastercard, and Discover). No checks. **Photo ID is required for posting**.

_It may still take several hours after bond is posted for a person to be processed for release, especially if a mass arrest occured_.
