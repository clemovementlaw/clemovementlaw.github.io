title: How do I post bail for someone?
---
To obtain a [Cleveland Municipal Court bond](http://www.city.cleveland.oh.us/CityofCleveland/Home/Government/CityAgencies/PublicSafety/Corrections/Bonds) directly, visit the [2nd floor of the Justice Center at 1200 Ontario Street](https://goo.gl/maps/9cPspHcHCY82). **Photo ID is required for posting**. The City Clerk of Courts office can be reached a (216) 664-4790.

_It may still take several hours after bond is posted for a person to be processed for release, especially if a mass arrest occured_.
