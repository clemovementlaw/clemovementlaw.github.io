title: 'Is there a bail fund? '

We are administering a **very limited** bail fund for those who cannot afford to post bond on their own. We cannot guarantee bail assistance for any specific arrestee and are prioritizing those with serious medical conditions, safety concerns, and/or childcare responsibilities. To donate to our bail fund, visit [https://rally.org/f/iZvxNKUJD60](https://rally.org/f/iZvxNKUJD60).
