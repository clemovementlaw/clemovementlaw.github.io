Sort of. A judge can’t prevent you from exercising your constitutional rights; however, you are required to comply with the terms of your bond which may include a stay away order from certain people or property. Also, while an additional arrest technically won’t influence your original charges, your bail may be set higher or with more strigent conditions for subsequent arrests.
