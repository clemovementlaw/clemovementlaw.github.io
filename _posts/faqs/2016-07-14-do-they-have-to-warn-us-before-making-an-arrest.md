title: Do they have to warn us before making an arrest?
---
It depends. Under the Cityâ€™s new [mass arrest dispersal order](http://www.acluohio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CDP-RevisedDispersalOrder-2015_0827.pdf), officers must warn demonstrators three times and identify exit routes prior to engaging in a mass arrest. However, this is only applies to mass arrests for unlawful assembly and may not apply in all other circumstances.
