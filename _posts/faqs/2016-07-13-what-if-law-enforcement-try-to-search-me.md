* Loudly & clearly state, "_I do not consent to any searches_" but do **not** attempt to phsyically resist or interfere with the officer's actions.
* If you are being detained, officers may frisk you for weapons. A frisk is a brief over-the-clothing pat down that does **not** require you to empty your pockets or opening your bags.
