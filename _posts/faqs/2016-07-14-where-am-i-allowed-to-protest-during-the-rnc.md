* _Generally_, sidewalks and parks are considered public forums for free speech activity and do **not** require a permit **unless** they involve a large amount of people or the coordination of city-provided services.
* Permits are _generally_ required for demonstrations that take place in the street, block vehicular or pedestrian traffic, require the coordination of city services, or involve amplified sound. 
	* If an impromptu demonstration is planned as a result of unfolding events, organizers are required to notify the Cleveland Division of Police eight hours in advance by calling Field Operations at (216) 623-5011.
