  I think my friend/loved one may be being housed in an inappropriately gendered
  facility. What can I do?

Call us as soon as possible with their legal name, date of arrest, & the jail they're being housed at (_if known_).

We are sending attorneys down to the jails for client visits as arrests occur and are prioritizing those with medical and/or safety concerns.
