* Stay calm and ask if you are being detained.
  * (1) If the answer is no, you are free to leave.
  * (2) If the answer is yes, you must stay but are not obligated to answer any questions.
* Loudly & clearly state, "_I am going to remain silent_" and then remain silent - even if officers continue to speak to you.
* **Be aware that law enforcement can lie to you to coerce you into speaking**.
