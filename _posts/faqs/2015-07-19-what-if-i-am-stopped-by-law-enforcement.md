* Stay calm and ask "_Am I being detained?_"
  * (1) If the answer is no, ask "_Am I free to leave?_" 
  	* (a) If the answer is no, you are being detained.
  	* (b) If the answer is yes, you are free to disengage & leave.
  * (2) If the answer is yes, you must stay but are **not** obligated to answer **any** questions.
* Loudly & clearly state, "_I am going to remain silent_" and then remain completely silent - even if officers continue to speak to you.
	* (1)If you begin to speak for **any** reason, you must verbally reinvoke your right to remain silent.
* **Be aware** that law enforcement can lie to you to coerce you into speaking.
