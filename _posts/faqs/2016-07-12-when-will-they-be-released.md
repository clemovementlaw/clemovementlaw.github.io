title: When will they be released?
---
Generally, arrestees must be processed within 48 hours or within a “reasonable amount of time” of their arrest. [Cleveland Municipal Court](https://clevelandmunicipalcourt.org/) has [cleared their dockets and extended their hours](http://www.clevelandmunicipalcourt.org/rnc-week-special-instructions) from 8:30am-4:30pm to 5:00am to 1:00am in order to speed up the processing of RNC arrestees. However, processing time still depends on how quickly the police and prosecutors complete the arrestees' charging paperwork.

**Please notify us if arrestees are being held for longer than 48 hours**. Upon being retained by the arrestees, we may be able fight in court to have them released.
