title: When will they be released?
---
Generally, arrestees must be processed within 48 hours or within a “reasonable amount of time” of their arrest. Cleveland Municipal Court has cleared their dockets and extended their hours from 8:30am-4:30pm to 5:00am to 1:00am in order to speed up the processing of RNC arrestees. However, processing time still depends on how quickly the police and prosecutors complete the arrestees' charging paperwork.
