The [Ohio NLG](https://www.ohionlg.org), the [Cleveland NAACP](http://clevelandnaacp.org/), & partners are working to provide legal representation for as many arrestees as possible. However, if large-scale mass arrests occur, we may not be able to provide or find representation for everyone. Call our hotline (216-505-0654) as soon as possible upon release to report your arrest and we'll do what we can! 

If you cannot afford an attorney, you may also qualify for a public defender. The [Cuyahoga County Public Defender](http://publicdefender.cuyahogacounty.us/) can be reached at (216) 443-7223.
