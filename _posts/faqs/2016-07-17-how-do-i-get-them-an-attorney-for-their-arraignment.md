---
_Make sure that they specifically request a NLG/NAACP/partner attorneys before their arraignment or bond hearing._

We will be present at court and available – **UPON REQUEST** – to represent people at arraignment/bond hearings. Individuals **MUST specifically ask for an NLG/NAACP/partner attorney** in order for us to make an appearance in court. If they cannot afford an attorney and do not request us, they will be assigned a public defender. Individuals may also retain their own counsel.
