After arrest, people may end up in:

* **Temporary detention** _(low-level allegations/charges for non-violent offenses)_: They will be processed and then, while detained, notified of their charges and have their bond set (according to a pre-determined bond schedule). Bond will either be money bond (must pay to be released) or personal bond (no payment, but there may be other conditions for released). After they are given charging paperwork and their bond is set (and paid), they will be released and issued a summons to appear in court later that day or the next day for arraignment. If a not guilty please is entered, they will have to continue to return to court until their case is resolved.

* **Longer detention** _(more serious allegations/charges, such as violence or propery damage)_: They will be processed and then, straight from jail informed of their charges and taken to court for arraignment. Bond, either be money bond (must pay to be released) or personal bond (no payment, but there may be other conditions for released), will also be set. If a not guilty please is entered, they will have to continue to return to court until their case is resolved.  

NLG/NAACP/partner attorneys will be present at court and available – **UPON REQUEST** – to represent people at arraignment/bond hearings. Individuals **MUST specifically ask for an NLG/NAACP/partner attorney** in order for us to make an appearance in court. If they cannot afford an attorney and do not request us, they will be assigned a public defender. Individuals may also retain their own counsel.
