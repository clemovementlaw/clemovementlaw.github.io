After being transported to a holding facility and processed, either 1) the district attorney will opt to not file charges and they will be released or 2) they will go before a judge for either their initial appearance (misdemeanors) or a preliminary arraignment (felonies) within 48 hours or a "reasonable amount of time." At this stage, they will be notified of the charges against them, their bond (the amount of money or conditions agreed to in order secure release) will be set, their plea will be entered (those without an attorney will automatically have a "not guitly" plea entered), and they will be assigned to a trial judge. 

We aim to have Guild-affilied attorneys at the courts to represent everyone at their initial appearances and preliminary arraignments. If you do not want an NLG attorney and cannot afford an attorney on your own, you will be assigned a public defender.
