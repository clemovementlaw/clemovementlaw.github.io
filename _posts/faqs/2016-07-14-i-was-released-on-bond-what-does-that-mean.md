Bond is designed to insure that you will show up for court when required. If you fail to appear for you court dates, the judge will issue a warrant (known as a "capias") for your arrest and either your bondsman or a deputy sheriff could be sent out to arrest you. Once the capias is issued, any contact you have with law enforcement could result in your arrest.
