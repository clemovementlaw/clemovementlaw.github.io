Bond is designed to guarantee your attendence at all scheduled court dates. If you fail to appear for a court appearance, the judge will issue a warrant (known as a "_capias_") for your arrest and may send a bondsman or a deputy sheriff out to arrest you. Once the capias is issued, **any** contact you have with law enforcement could **result in your arrest**.

**Make sure the the courts have your correct address** and let us know if you require assistance getting to or from your court dates.
