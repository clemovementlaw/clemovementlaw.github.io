  what do I do with it?

Write down the date/time/location of collection and call our hotline at (216) 5050-NlG (654) to let us know! We may want to collect it immediately or we may need you to hold on to it for awhile. 

**Avoid handling physical evidence as much as possible.** Place it in a labeled (date/time/location of collection) ziplock bag until we are able to collect it.
