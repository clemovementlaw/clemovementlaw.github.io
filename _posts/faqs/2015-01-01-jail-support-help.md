Those arrested in Cleveland are usually taken to [Cleveland City Jail](http://www.city.cleveland.oh.us/CityofCleveland/Home/Government/CityAgencies/PublicSafety/Corrections/Cleveland_City_Jail) located in the [Justice Center at 1300 Ontario Street](https://goo.gl/maps/uxca79TWK1n). For the RNC, Cleveland has contracted with [Cuyahoga County](http://sheriff.cuyahogacounty.us/en-US/Cuyahoga-County-Corrections-Center.aspx) (also located within the Justice Center), [Geauga County](http://www.sheriff.co.geauga.oh.us/Divisions/Corrections/Jail), and [Summit County](https://sheriff.summitoh.net/index.php/correctionsjail) jails to house additional arrestees. There is also the possibility that arrestees will be held at various [Cleveland Division of Police District stations](http://www.city.cleveland.oh.us/CityofCleveland/Home/Government/CityAgencies/PublicSafety/Police/Police_Districts), the [House of Corrections](http://www.city.cleveland.oh.us/CityofCleveland/Home/Government/CityAgencies/PublicSafety/Corrections/House_of_Correction) (the “Workhouse”), or the [Oriana House](http://www.orianahouse.org/).
