  My friend/loved one has a medical condition & needs their medication. How do I
  make sure they get it?

Call us as soon as possible with their legal name, the jail they're being housed at (if known), and information about the medication, and locate a physical copy of their precription if at all possible. We are sending attorneys down to the jails for client visits as arrests occur and are prioritizing those with medical and/or safety concerns.
