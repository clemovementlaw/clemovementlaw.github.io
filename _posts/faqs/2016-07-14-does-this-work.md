  My friend/loved one has a medical condition and needs their medication. How do
  I get it to them?

Call us with their legal name and medication information. Try to track down a copy of their physical copy of their precription if possible. We are sending attorneys down to the jails for client visits as arrests occur and are prioritizing those with medical and/or safety concerns.
