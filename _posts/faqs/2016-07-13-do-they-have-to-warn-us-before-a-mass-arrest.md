title: Do they have to warn us before a mass arrest?
---
It depends. Under the Cityâ€™s new mass arrest dispersal order, officers must identify exit routes and warn demonstrators three times prior to mass arresting demonstrators. However, this is only applies to mass arrests for unlawful assembly and may not apply in other circumstances, such as violence.
