  make sure they get it/get it to them?

Call us as soon as possible with their legal name, date of their arrest, the jail they're being housed at (_if known_), and information about their medication. It is **extremely helpful**__ if you are able to provide a physical copy of their prescription.

We are dispatching local attorneys to the jails as arrests occur and are prioritizing those with medical and/or safety concerns.
