All currently available information about arrestees can be obtained by calling our jail support hotline at (216) 5050-NLG (654).

Keep in mind that in the event of mass arrests, arrestees will likely be sitting in police vans, busses, etc for several hours and will not be immediately transported to the jail for processing and phone calls. Check in with our jail support hotline and stay by your phone in case they call you.
